// In development, always fetch from the network and do not enable offline support.
// This is because caching would make development more difficult (changes would not
// be reflected on the first load after each change).

// Caution! Be sure you understand the caveats before publishing an application with
// offline support. See https://aka.ms/blazor-offline-considerations
